### Exercise:

Create an online map showing the bus stops between Harvard &amp; MIT using the Mapbox API.

### How to Run:

**Recommended way**:

1. Download [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)
2. Add the [Live Server Plugin](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer)
3. Open the Project Directory
4. Click on the "Go Live" icon on the bottom right of VS Code

**Alternative Way:**

1. Download to repo
2. Drag `index.html` into a browser window

### Roadmap of future improvements:

- Adding the Google Street API to view 3D images of each bus stop
- Adding a second page named "Schedules" to show the current bus stop scheduling
- Adding occupancy tracking to see if the bus has available seating
